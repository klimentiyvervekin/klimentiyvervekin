# 👋 Hi, I’m Klim

I’m 30 years old and currently taking a **Web Development** course at [neue fische](https://www.neuefische.de/) with a focus on **frontend development**.  
This repository is where I share my progress, projects, and learning journey.

## 🎨 Background

My background is in art — I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Fine Arts** and also completed an *Ausbildung* as a **Gestaltungstechnischer Assistent**.  
Now I want to merge my artistic side with the technical world of programming, bringing creative ideas to life and building useful things for the world.

## 🌱 Goals

- Grow as a frontend developer  
- Combine art and code  
- Work on creative, meaningful projects  

## 🎧 Hobbies

- Producing music (especially **techno**)  
- Playing video games  
- Sports & fitness  
- Watching UFC
